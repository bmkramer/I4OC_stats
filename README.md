# I4OA - monthly statistics

Monthly statistics for Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC) 

Querying Crossref API for proportion of current (= current year and 2 previous years) and backfile DOIs journals that include references in their metadata, per Crossref member ID.

*Background:* From June 2022 onwards, all references deposited in Crossref are set to open. However, not all publishers deposit references for all their publications. This repo charts the availability of references in Crossref per publisher. NB It is recognized that not all publications will have references. 

Data are also collected monthly for journal articles, book chapters, preprints, proceedings articles and proceedings.
